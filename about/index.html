	<p>Hi, that's me. I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the Unversity College London working in the field of extrasolar planet characterisation.  
	I specialise in the data analysis and atmospheric modelling of exoplanet atmospheres. Exoplanets are planets that orbit other stars. When one of these planets happens to pass between its host star
	and us, some of the star's light filters through the atmosphere of that plannet. Now that is a tiny amount and extremely hard to detect with our current technology. For this reason, 
	I focused my PhD thesis (available <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/ingo_documents/ingo_thesis.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>) on using machine learing techniques to 'learn' how to best mine for those 
	tiny planetary signals hidden within the noise of the instrument and star. Together with my students and collaborators, we have continued developing these algorithms and have recently 
	won the Spitzer Space Telescope Data Challenge (paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05101' target='_blank'>here</a>) as the most reliable and accurate algorithm. </p>
	
	<p>
	More recently, togetehr with my student turned colleague, Marco Rocchetto, I have focused more on the theoretical modelling of the atmospheres of these planets. In particular on the question: 
	What can we learn from current and future observations? How do they constrain our knowledge of the atmospheric chemistry and temperatures? </br>
	To answer these questions, we developed the Tau-REx retrieval framework (for more info, have a look at the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/journal/'>projects</a> page. In many ways this is the 
	field leading software to analysing atmospheric spectra of exoplanets and we are developing this framework with modern deep learning techniques in mind. Here deep learning can help
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Generally regarding this website. This is a work in progress. I want to provide an archive of our recent open-source codes (they are on GitHub but an overview is needed) and data here. 
	Also some code-documentation and a messaging board for code-related questions is planned. And finally I want to put some more photos up in a gallary... let's see!

					<p>BLAH BLAH  Hi, that's me. I'm a post-doctoral research assistant at the Unversity College London working in the field of extrasolar planet characterisation.  
					 I am currently funded through the European Research Council grant (Exolights, PI: Tinetti) for which I act as the scientific coordinator. </p>
					 <p> My research interests range from Infra-red detector characterisation and modelling to data de-trending using machine learning algorithms to radiative transfer modelling of exoplanetary atmospheres.
					 I also have a keen interest to go into the development of data anaylsis techniques for direct imagine of extrasolar planets in the future. You can find a summary of my research in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/myresearch.html"> My Research </a> section and 
					 a summary of my current projects in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects.html">Current Projects</a> section. </p>
