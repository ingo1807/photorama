					<p>Hi, that's me. I'm a post-doctoral research assistant at the Unversity College London working in the field of extrasolar planet characterisation.  
					 I am currently funded through the European Research Council grant (Exolights, PI: Tinetti) for which I act as the scientific coordinator. </p>
					 <p> My research interests range from Infra-red detector characterisation and modelling to data de-trending using machine learning algorithms to radiative transfer modelling of exoplanetary atmospheres.
					 I also have a keen interest to go into the development of data anaylsis techniques for direct imagine of extrasolar planets in the future. You can find a summary of my research in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/myresearch.html"> My Research </a> section and 
					 a summary of my current projects in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects.html">Current Projects</a> section. </p>
